# prompts
This project offers solutions for various scenarios involving OpenAI APIs and the utilization of prompts.

The initial feature allows for response caching when working in a development environment. This enables developers to work more efficiently and cost-effectively.

The second feature allows for the uploading of all prompt-related information, such as prompt templates, parameters, and responses, to a centralized server. This is typically done in production systems.

Having the information stored centrally allows for conducting experiments, such as modifying the prompt template and measuring performance, or transitioning to a different model version or provider and evaluating performance.
